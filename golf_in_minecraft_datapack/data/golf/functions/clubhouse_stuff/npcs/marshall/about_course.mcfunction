tellraw @p ["","[",{"text":"Golf Marshall","color":"gold"},"] This here is Bloody Rock Oaks, the finest Golfing destination this side of the God King's Realm!  We've got 6 Holes here with a difficulty curve geared towards Intermediate players.  We'll warm you up with a few easy-going holes first and then heat things up a bit towards the end of the round!  We've even got a rare Par 6 that capstones the experience!","\n",{"text":"> Okay but...  How does this place exist?
